    Manage a list of SignalModel from specific events during a recording.  

    The goal is to extract signals from events (segments : sleep stages or 
    clean segments for analysis). Could also be spindles.

    Create a new list of SignalModel based on the events (create = True), otherwise
    select items from the list of SignalModel based on the events (create = False).

    Parameters
    -----------
        signals : a list of SignalModel
            Each item of the list is a SignalModel object as described below:
                signal.samples : The actual signal data as numpy list
                signal.sample_rate : the sampling rate of the signal
                signal.channel : current channel label
                signal.start_time : The start time of the signal in sec
                signal.end_time : The end time of the signal in sec
                (for more info : look into common/SignalModel)
        events : pandas DataFrame
            df of events with field
            'group': Group of events this event is part of (String)
            'name': Name of the event (String)
            'start_sec': Starting time of the event in sec (Float)
            'duration_sec': Duration of the event in sec (Float)
            'channels' : Channel where the event occures (String)
            (For now events are expected to be on all channels)
        events_names : String
            String of the desired events to take in account. Separated by a 
            comma. ex)'stage_2' or ex)'stage_1,stage2,stage3'

    Returns
    -----------    
        signals_from_events : a list of SignalModel
            Each item is a SignalModel based on one item from events.
            (For now events are expected to be on all channels)
