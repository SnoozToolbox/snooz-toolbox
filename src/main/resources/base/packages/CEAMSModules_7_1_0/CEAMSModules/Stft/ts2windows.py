Module to shape a 1-D wide array of samples into 2D array of windows of samples.
The compute function needs the inputs : 1-D array to convert, number of 
samples in the sliding window, number of samples that overlaps between 2 
windows and returns a 2-D array shaped as [nwin x nsample_win].  The return 
2D-array is a view in the memory, the real data is not duplicated in case of
overlap between windows, therefore it is not writable.
