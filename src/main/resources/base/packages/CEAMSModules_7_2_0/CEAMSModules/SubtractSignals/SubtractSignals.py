"""
    Subtract signals from a specific channel from the signals of a list of channels.
    This module can be used to reformat a montage.
    For example, to reformat C3-CLE to C3-A2, the input channel is [C3-CLE], and the channel to subtract is [A2-CLE].
    To rename properly the channel, the new channel name can be provided.
