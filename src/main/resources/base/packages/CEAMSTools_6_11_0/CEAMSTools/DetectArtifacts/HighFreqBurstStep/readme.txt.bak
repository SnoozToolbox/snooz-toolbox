Fixed threshold (mode and std)
The power is log10 transformed to make the data more normally distributed. The histogram (nbins=50) of the power of all selected channels is often skewed right.  
Therefore, the threshold is based on the mode and the standard deviation (STD), but std is calculated only on data equal to or less than the mode.
An artifact is possibly identified when the log10(power) > (mode+threshold*STD)

Adaptive threshold (baseline)
An adaptive threshold is computed from a baseline window (BSL) of 30 s around the segment to evaluate.  A segment with a power x times the median power of the baseline is possibly an artifact. The adaptive threshold may be too sensitive when the EEG recording does not include much high frequency noise. 

Power ratio threshold (relative power)
High frequency bursts can be masked (thus non-disturbing) by a strong low frequency signal. An artifact is possibly identified when the relative power (25-64 Hz)/(1-64 Hz) > threshold.

A segment whose power exceeds the 3 thresholds is considered an artifact.
